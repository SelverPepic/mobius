"""Ask the self-hosted replacement helper for a container-only upgrade.

An installation whose running image predates the image-owned boot transaction
(``backend/runtime/boot-protocol``) cannot take a release that changes Python
packages: its served code refuses to install source for packages its image
lacks. This moves only the container to a newer official image and leaves the
served source untouched. The new image's boot transaction then checks that
unchanged source against itself (an image newer than the source's release is
allowed) and probes it, with the image's own release as the floor. After that,
Settings' ordinary update installs the release, because its packages are
already in the image.

Run it inside the Möbius container as the ``mobius`` user, from the fetched
upstream so an older installation needs nothing new installed::

    git -C /data/platform fetch --no-tags origin +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main
    git -C /data/platform show origin/main:scripts/request-container-upgrade.py \
      | python3 - [--check] [--target <40-hex official release>]

It changes nothing but the helper's inbox, and only after these checks pass:
the target is a fetched official release that ships this bridge, descends
from the running image, and is not older than any official Python package
declaration of the installed source; no update is prepared or parked; and the
helper is installed and idle. They hold the updater's lock while checking and
requesting. The helper then drains chats, replaces the
container, verifies it, and restores the previous container if it is not
healthy. See scripts/CONTAINER-REBUILD.md.
